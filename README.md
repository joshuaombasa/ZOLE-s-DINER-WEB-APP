This is a JavaScript code that creates a menu for a restaurant website, allows users to add items to their order and then proceed to payment.
The menuArray is an array of objects that contains information about the menu items, such as their name, price, and ingredients.

The render() function creates the HTML for the menu items by iterating over the menuArray and creating a section element for each item.
